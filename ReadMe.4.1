"Pcal" Version 4.1

This is an intermediate release of "Pcal", the PostScript calendar making
program.

Major changes:

    1) Of interest to Pcal hackers and installers:

    .	The Un*x flavor of Pcal is now considerably smarter about finding
	the date file, using the PATH environment variable to identify
	the directory where the executable lives.  (This is so system-
	dependent that it exists only for Un*x; in fact, it may require
	some tweaking for your particular system.  See the comments in
	pcalutil.c regarding X_OK.)


    2) New command-line options:

    .	The "-v" option has been added to print version information without
	the entire usage message.

    .	The "-G" option has been added to print "gray" dates as filled
	outlines (thanks to Richard Dyson for the idea).


    3) New date file functionality:

    .	Pcal now supports format specifiers (derived mostly from strftime())
	which allow the user to substitute the current month, day, weekday,
	year, etc. into a text or foot string.  For further information,
	refer to the manual page and/or the comments in "pcal.c".


    4) Other new functionality:

    .	The default moon phase algorithm has been replaced with an
	astronomer-quality version; moon file ".moonXX" will continue
	to be supported for now.

    5) Portability:

    .   Some VMS-specific files have been updated.  Also, a TeX style sheet
	is now included in the distribution [this has since been dropped
	since whoever wrote it was no longer around to keep it in sync
	with the man page - any volunteers?].


Credit where credit is due:

The following people contributed to Pcal v4.1:

	Overall coordinator, troff manual page:		Joe Brownlee
	VMS/TeX support, moon phase algorithm:		Richard Dyson
	Other C and PostScript code:			Andrew Rogers
 
Although they probably wouldn't recognize the current version, countless
others worked on Pcal long before any of us ever heard of it; see the
Orig.ReadMe file and topline comments in pcal.c.
