"Pcal" Version 4.6

This is a new release of "Pcal", the PostScript calendar program.  The major
new features are:

	a) the "-a" flag to select a language other than English;

	b) the "-T" flag (and \f* escape sequences) to select bold or italic
	   typefaces in date/note box text;

	c) the "year all" directive to wildcard date file entries against
	   all applicable years;

	d) the distribution includes .html and .cgi files for setting up a
	   Pcal server using Netscape (maybe others; I haven't tried them)
	   under Un*x;

	e) the date box height for single-month portrait-mode calendars
	   has been expanded from 80 points to 117;

	f) the distribution includes moon phase files for 1997 and 1998

	g) two new keywords, "nearest_before" and "nearest_after", are
	   supported.

	h) the default century has been changed from 1900 to the current
	   century.

All are described in detail below.


Major changes:

    1) Of interest to Pcal hackers and installers:

      .	The following new files have been added to the distribution:

		days.h		day names in multiple languages (see -a below)
		months.h	month names in multiple languages
		calendar.gk	calendar with Greek holidays (in Greek)
		calendar.uk	calendar with British holidays
		fonttest_e	test Esperanto font mapping (see -a below)

		cvt7to8.c	To avoid mailer problems, days.h, months.h,
		cvt8to7.c	and calendar.gk are distributed in 7-bit
				format (8-bit characters are represented as
				octal escape sequences).  cvt7to8.c converts
				these files to true 8-bit format to
				facilitate editing by users with 8-bit
				editors; cvt8to7.c converts them back to
				7-bit format for mailing.

	The distribution also includes the "ReadMe" files from several
	earlier releases.

      .	moon94 and moon95 have been replaced with moon97 and moon98.

      .	My [AWR] site finally got a color printer, and after playing with it
	for a while I decided I prefer the appearance of black outlines
	(dates when -O flag is specified) to color outlines; if you agree,
	define the symbol OUTLINE_BLACK in the COPTS line of your Makefile.

      .	The Un*x Makefile supports selecting the default language (see
	-a description below).

      .	The Un*x Makefile has two new targets: "compress" to create a
	compressed 'tar' file (suitable for installation in a public ftp
	directory, WWW page, etc.) and "uuencode" to create a uuencoded
	version thereof.


    2) New command-line options:

      .	Pcal now supports the -a <language> flag to generate calendars
	in the following languages:

		de	German
		en	English [default]
		eo	Esperanto
		es	Spanish
		fr	French
		gr	Greek
		it	Italian

	In order to display diacritical marks, languages other than English
	require that the fonts be remapped (Esperanto uses a stripped-down
	version of ISO 8859-3; the others use "Latin1").  If no remapping
	is specified, \fIpcal\fP selects a remapping appropriate to the
	selected language; note that the Greek language also requires an
	ELOT-928 font (available from Angelo Haritsis, ah@doc.ic.ac.uk).

	If Esperanto is selected, Pcal converts [cghjsuCGHJSU][xX^] and
	[uU]~ to the corresponding accented character; e.g. "jxauxdo"
	"j^au~do", or any equivalent form will print as "j-circumflex a
	u-breve d o".

	Day and month names in the date file may be expressed in either
	the default language specified at compile-time or the language
	selected on the command line.

	Pcal predefines the symbol "lang_XX" where XX is the two-character
	abbreviation for the current language.

      .	Pcal now supports the -T [B|I|R] flag to select the typeface (Bold,
	Italic, or Roman) for printing date/note text (see below).  This flag
	may be specified multiple times within the date file (via "opt") to
	reset the font style on the fly - for example, to print all holidays
	in Bold.  (Also see "'troff'-like escape sequences" below.)
	

    3) New date file functionality:

      .	Pcal now supports the "year all" (or "year *") directive to address
	a long-standing Pcal deficiency: the requirement that recurring dates
	appear in the date file once for each year.  While "year all" is in
	effect, pcal will wildcard each date specification (and note box
	entry) in the date file into a date entry for each applicable year,
	as determined by the starting month/year and number of months.

	"Year all" is disabled by a date of the form "mm/dd/yy" or a "year
	yy" directive.

      . Pcal now supports 'troff'-like escape sequences to change the style
	of the font used for printing the text: \fB = Bold; \fI = Italic;
	\fR = Roman; \fP = previous font.  (Since there is no consistent
	means of converting a generic font name to its bold or Italic
	equivalent, these are simulated through overstrikes and 'makefont'
	respectively.)  Pcal also supports their HTML equivalents: <B> =
	Bold; <I> = Italic; </B> or </I> = previous font (lower case is
	also accepted).

	Each of these escape sequences causes a word break, so the effective
	granularity is word-level, not character-level.  Maybe some day...

	The font style is reset to Roman following each line break.

      . Pcal now supports three Orthodox Easter related dates: "GEaster",
	"Gstgeorge", "Gmarcus".

      .	Pcal now supports the "nearest_before" and "nearest_after" keywords
	to specify how pcal is to disambiguate between two dates that are
	equally near; e.g., "nonworkday nearest_before [Wed.] 9/25/96" refers
	to Sunday, 9/22 and "nonworkday nearest_after 9/25/96" refers to
	Saturday, 9/28.  (Note that in the absence of any such ambiguity,
	"nearest" takes precedence over "before" or "after": "nonworkday
	nearest_before 9/26/96" refers to Saturday, 9/28.)


    4) Other new functionality:

      . Pcal predefines the symbol v4_6; this allows the user to ifdef out
	v4.6-specific constructs from date files that might also be used
	by older versions of Pcal.

      .	Pcal compresses the date font text as necessary to prevent overflow
	of extremely long words into the next box.

      . The distribution now includes pcal.html (HTML form to generate
	single-month calendars), pcalw.html (HTML form to generate whole-year
	calendars) and pcal.cgi (common /bin/sh script to parse the options
	selected on either of the HTML forms and pass them to pcal).  (You
	will need to tweak site-specific paths in all of them.)

      .	The date box height for single-month portrait-mode calendars has
	been expanded from 80 points to 117.  If you prefer the original
	date box proportions (basically a scaled-down landscape-mode
	calendar), compile with -DORIG_BOX_HEIGHT.

      .	The default century for two-digit years has been changed from 1900
	to the current century.  This presumes standard Un*x behavior: that
	the "tm_year" field in the "tm" struct (<time.h>) represents the
	current year minus 1900, not the current year itself; if this is not
	the case on your system, change the TM_YEAR definition (pcaldefs.h)
	accordingly.


    5) Bug fixes:

      .	Fixed a long-standing (but not previously reported) bug in readfile.c
	which caused Pcal to crash upon an "undef <sym>" in the date file.

      .	Depending on the underlying hardware, a bit pattern of all zeroes
	may not necessarily be a null (or even a valid) pointer; pointers
	previously assumed initialized by a calloc() call are now initialized
	explicitly to NULL.

      .	The Un*x "calendar" utility interprets asterisks as wildcards;
	consequently, v4.6 does not propagate asterisks from the date file
	to the -c output (note also that holidays with no associated text
	will not be printed).  To retain them (as per v4.5), define the
	symbol KEEP_ASTERISKS in the COPTS line of your Makefile.

      .	Vestiges of a never-implemented experiment have been deleted from
	next_token() in exprpars.c.

      .	Fixed a long-standing bug where "note/1" text would overwrite the
	small calendar for the next month if the "-k" flag was specified and
	the month began on Sunday.  [merged from v4.7 12/21/97]
